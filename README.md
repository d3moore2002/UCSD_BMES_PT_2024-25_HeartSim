# 🫀 Mechanical Simulation of the Human Heart (Left Side)
*A Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Project at UC San Diego, 2024-25*

## 📄 Abstract ![](https://via.placeholder.com/40)

This student-led project simulates the mechanical function of the **left side of the human heart**. The model mimics blood flow viscosity using PVC pipes, 3D-printed components, and custom silicone valves to represent the left atrium, left ventricle, aorta, mitral valve, aortic valve and capillary bed. **Mechanical Team** successfully designed the diorama through laser cutting, wood working, and painting, 3D printed connection tubings and silicon molding the mitral valve and aortic valve, and built a hydraulic pump system simulating the left ventricle. **Software/Electrical Team** implemented the Driver actuation and control of the NEMA 23 stepper motor used as the pump, servo actuation and control of mitral and aortic valves, wired and coded the pizioelectric pressure sensors to calculate the hydrostatic pressure inside the chambers, and Wired and coded the Hall effect water flow sensor to calculate the cardiac output of our system as blood leaves the aorta. The final system serves as a learning and research tool for understanding heart mechanics in academic settings and learning useful engineering skills applicable across various disciplines.

## 🧩 Project Components ![](https://via.placeholder.com/40)

1. **Flow_Connections**  
   Responsible for directing simulated blood through the heart model. This includes tubing, valves, and joints that form the circulatory loop.

2.  **Mechanical_Valve_Servo_Actuation**  
   Controls the 

3. **Mechanical_Pump_Actuation**  
   Controls the hydraulic mechanism simulating the left ventricle. Driven by a NEMA 23 stepper motor, it enables cyclic pumping of the working fluid.

4. **Pressure_Sensors**  
   Collects pressure data from key locations in the system to monitor hemodynamic conditions and analyze flow resistance or chamber contraction accuracy.

5. **Diorama_Setup**  
   The full physical layout including the anatomical heart model, structural support, and the visual display for educational or research purposes.

6. **Combining_Everything**  
   This is the full system integration zone—where all electrical, mechanical, and sensor components come together for complete functionality and testing.
