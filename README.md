# 🫀 Mechanical Simulation of the Human Heart (Left Side)
*A Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Project at UC San Diego, 2024-25*

---

## 📄 Abstract ![](https://via.placeholder.com/40)
This student-led project simulates the mechanical function of the **left side of the human heart**. The model mimics blood flow viscosity using **PVC pipes**, **3D-printed components**, and **custom silicone valves** to represent the left atrium, left ventricle, aorta, and capillary bed.

**Mechanical Team** was responsible for:
- Designing the diorama
- 3D printing and silicon modeling
- Building a hydraulic pump system simulating the left ventricle

**Software/Electrical Team** handled:
- Driver actuation of the **NEMA 23 stepper motor** used as the pump
- Servo actuation of **mitral and aortic valves** 
- Wiring and coding of **pizioelectric pressure sensors** to calculate the hydrostatic pressure inside the chambers
- Wiring and coding of **Hall effect water flow sensor** to calculate the cardiac output of our system

The final system serves as a **learning and research tool** for understanding heart mechanics in academic settings.
