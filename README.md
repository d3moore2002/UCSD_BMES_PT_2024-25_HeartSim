# BMES_2024-25_HeartSim
Repository for Heart Simulation Project for BMES at UC San Diego student led project team for the 2024-25 year. 

# 2/20/2025 Update 

Our flow sensor has arrived! I tested it and it works, but we have a few tasks to do.
1. Everyone read the tutorial https://www.luisllamas.es/en/water-flow-measurement-arduino-flow-meter/.
2. We will wire the sensor (shouldn't take that long)
3. We will then split up into two groups (one for testing, one for adjusting the code)

# 2/2/2025 Update 
We have split up everyone in the software/electrical team into 3 groups, during Thursday's 2/6/2025 Meeting, everyone on software will write their name under the team they want to be a part of for future reference
