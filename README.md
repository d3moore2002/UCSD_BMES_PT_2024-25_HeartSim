# 🫀 Mechanical Simulation of the Human Heart (Left Side)
*A Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Project at UC San Diego, 2024-25*

---

## 📄 Abstract ![](https://via.placeholder.com/40)
This student-led project simulates the mechanical function of the **left side of the human heart**. The model mimics blood flow viscosity using **PVC pipes**, **3D-printed components**, and **custom silicone valves** to represent the left atrium, left ventricle, aorta, and capillary bed.

**Mechanical Team** was responsible for:
- Designing the diorama
- 3D printing and silicon modeling
- Building a hydraulic pump system simulating the left ventricle

**Software/Electrical Team** handled:
- Driver actuation of the **NEMA 23 stepper motor** used as the pump
- Servo actuation of **mitral and aortic valves** 
- Wiring and coding of **pizioelectric pressure sensors** to calculate the hydrostatic pressure inside the chambers
- Wiring and coding of **Hall effect water flow sensor** to calculate the cardiac output of our system

The final system serves as a **learning and research tool** for understanding heart mechanics in academic settings.

## 🧩 Project Components ![](https://via.placeholder.com/40)

1. **Flow_Connections**  
   Responsible for directing simulated blood through the heart model. This includes tubing, valves, and joints that form the circulatory loop.

2.  **Mechanical_Valve_Servo_Actuation**  
   Controls the hydraulic mechanism simulating the left ventricle. Driven by a NEMA 23 stepper motor, it enables cyclic pumping of the working fluid.

3. **Mechanical_Pump_Actuation**  
   Controls the hydraulic mechanism simulating the left ventricle. Driven by a NEMA 23 stepper motor, it enables cyclic pumping of the working fluid.

4. **Pressure_Sensors**  
   Collects pressure data from key locations in the system to monitor hemodynamic conditions and analyze flow resistance or chamber contraction accuracy.

5. **Diorama_Setup**  
   The full physical layout including the anatomical heart model, structural support, and the visual display for educational or research purposes.

6. **Combining_Everything**  
   This is the full system integration zone—where all electrical, mechanical, and sensor components come together for complete functionality and testing.
