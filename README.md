# Abstract
This project aims to build a Mechanical Simulation of the left side of the human Heart. This is a student led project team for the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) at UC San Diego for the 2024-25 academic year. Our Mechanical model simulates the viscosity of the fluid flow that would happen in the heart, including chambers that represent the left atrium, left ventricle, the aorta, and the capillary bed being represented in our diorama by various PVC pipes, 3D printed components, . Mechanical was in charge with the Mechanical design of the diroham, inclduing 3D printing all the parts, silicon modeling the values, and desinging the hydrualic pump system that acts as the left ventricle pushing blood throughout the rest of the ebody. The software/electrical teams wired, and coded the atucation of the Nema 23 stepper motor used for the hydraulic pump, the actuation of the Micro 9g servos to represented the opening and closing of the mitrial and aortic valves, and. The prupose of this project is to be used as a simulation tool and visual aid to greater understand the mechansims behind the heart to be used as a learning tool for students, and possibiity a resource in research into modeling and understanding the functions of the heart at academic insitutions everywhere. 

The left side of the heart is tasked with recieving oxygenated blood and transporting it throughout the body.

For Flow Team
1. We tested the flow sensor on Thursday's meeting, read the tutorial link if you haven't and look at the FS300A code now that I had updated it with comments to try to understand how it works. The flow team will try testing the K value again to see it's accuracy. https://www.luisllamas.es/en/water-flow-measurement-arduino-flow-meter/ 
2. We want to adjust the sensor code to output flow in mL/min instead of L/min.

For Pressure Team
1. Read this tutorial on the pressure sensor we will be using https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micropressure-hookup-guide. Optional extra task someone who wants to work on the pressure sensor team can do is to upload an .ino file with Pressure Sensor code from the tutorial. If there are functions or aspects of code you don't know, add comments and try to be prepared to explain parts to help others.
2. We don't have the pressure sensors yet and probably won't on Sunday's meeting, so for now we will just be doing research and trying to understand the code from the tutorial.

For Pump Team
1. We are still waiting on project team, so work on two of the other projects for now.

# 2/20/2025 Update 

Our flow sensor has arrived! I tested it and it works, but we have a few tasks to do.
1. Everyone read the tutorial https://www.luisllamas.es/en/water-flow-measurement-arduino-flow-meter/.
2. We will wire the sensor (shouldn't take that long)
3. We will then split up into two groups (one for testing, one for adjusting the code)

K = f/Q, key equation

# 2/2/2025 Update 
We have split up everyone in the software/electrical team into 3 groups, during Thursday's 2/6/2025 Meeting, everyone on software will write their name under the team they want to be a part of for future reference
